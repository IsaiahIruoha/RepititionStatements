# RepititionStatements
APSC143 Assignment 4
In this assignment, you will use programming to help you determine whether to invest in a project. You will use repetition statements and previous course topics to create a program to accept an input of the economic values of an Engineering project. You will use these values to determine the economic feasibility of the project (i.e., is it profitable?) as well as determine the payback period for the project. This assignment will also aid you in determining economic feasibility in your APSC101 project.
